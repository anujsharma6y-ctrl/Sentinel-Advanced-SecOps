🛡️ Sentinel-Advanced-SecOps
An Advanced Cybersecurity Framework for Automated Threat Hunting, System Hardening, and Incident Response.
🚀 Projects Overview
This repository is a modular collection of 8 high-performance security tools built with Python. Each tool is designed to handle a specific stage of the Cyber Kill Chain.

1. Credential Leak Scanner
Description: Scans local environments and configuration files for exposed secrets.

Key Features: Detects hardcoded API keys, passwords, and sensitive environment variables to prevent identity theft.

2. Incident Response Playbook Automator
Description: A "Trigger-Action" engine for rapid threat containment.

Key Features: Executes automated mitigation steps like network isolation and process termination the moment an attack is confirmed.

3. Log-Based Intrusion Detector (L-IDS)
Description: A SIEM-lite correlation engine for system logs.

Key Features: Correlates events from multiple log sources (Auth + Web) to detect multi-stage attacks like Brute-force + Path Traversal.

4. Malware Hash Checker
Description: A forensic utility for file fingerprinting.

Key Features: Generates SHA-256 hashes for suspicious files and compares them against known malware databases for instant detection.

5. Ransomware Behavior Detector (Watchdog)
Description: A proactive filesystem monitor to stop encryption attacks.

Key Features: Detects abnormal file-renaming patterns and rapid encryption activities using the watchdog library.

6. Security Alert Automation
Description: A centralized notification hub for security events.

Key Features: Sends real-time alerts via Email or Telegram whenever a tool in the suite detects a critical threat.

7. Security Audit & Hardening Tool
Description: A compliance-focused script for system fortification.

Key Features: Audits system settings against security checklists and provides one-click remediation (Hardening) for SSH, Firewalls, and Permissions.

8. Threat Intelligence Feed Collector
Description: An OSINT tool to stay ahead of emerging threats.

Key Features: Automatically pulls the latest Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and malicious IPs from global threat intelligence APIs.
